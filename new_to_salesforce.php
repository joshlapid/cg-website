Unsuccessfully adopting a new system can cost teams a great deal of time, and ultimately money. It’s important to take in all the factors when using a new system such as user adoption, business process accountability, and more. Companies cannot afford to experiment their way through their initial deployment or take a wrong turn early in their Salesforce journey.</p>
